For its general release at the 2017 Microsoft Connect Conference, I carefully worked with marketing to create an exciting design that appealed to both Microsoft and non-Microsoft customers. With its generous use of App Center brand pink, large device screens, negative space, curves, and gradients the design breaks typical Microsoft standards to appeal to a younger, more independent developer audience.</p>

		  <p><strong>Process:</strong> With competitive analysis of other mobile software websites, I created a series of 4 wireframe layouts. I presented the wireframes to both App Center Marketing and Product teams to optimize the structure for their message. Once a layout was chosen, I moved forward with a hi-fidelity mockup that contained components that resonated with the mobile developer audience: large product shots, featured brands using the product, an interactive code example, feature descriptions, and supported platform logos. I also refined the demo mobile app screens provided by marketing to punch up web layout. When the design was approved, I tested the design for accessibility, optimized images for web, and oversaw frontend development to assure visual continuity with the mockup.</p></div>
